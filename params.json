After you have configured your etsy service file you can simply build the object your looking for and add it with a simple method call. Will be working on adding the functionality for all method calls, some need tweaking.\r\n\r\n# Example \r\n\t\t//Create a listing item, note by default we put items in a draft state unless you change it.\r\n\t\tListing draft = new Listing();\r\n\t\t//Enter all required data for processing\r\n\t\tdraft.setPrice(\"0.20\");\r\n\t\tdraft.setQuantity(new Double(\"0.0\"));\r\n\t\tdraft.setTitle(\"do not use\");\r\n\t\tdraft.setWhen_made(\"2010_2016\");\r\n\t\tdraft.setWho_made(\"i_did\");\r\n\t\tdraft.setDescription(\"fake\");\r\n\t\t//Existing shipping template is needed\r\n\t\tdraft.setShipping_template_id(new Long(\"18656190424\"));\r\n\t\t//Here is where the magic happens and using scribe we can push a new listing to the etsy server.\r\n\t\tdraft.createListing();",
