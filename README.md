# EtsyJavaApi
Etsy Java Api lets you configure oauth and make api calls based on the Etsy Api Framework.

Making call request and reading responses has never been easier. After you have configured your etsy service file you can simply build the object your looking for and add it with a simple method call. Will be working on adding the functionality for all method calls, some need tweaking.
